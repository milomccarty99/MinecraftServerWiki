Obsidian.md falls under 2 main categories:
 - markdown files
 - folders

I can go one of two ways:
1) generic view for folders, generic view for articles
2) hard code the paths

I think that I want to go generic view for folders and articles.

It is clear to me that I lost a lot of knowledge on how to implement a basic Flask site. I can keep 
going and get something shmooving.
